# EdgeRemover
Give you the freedom to choose aside from Microsoft Edge.

## Usage
1. Download from the release tab
2. Place it in wherever you want a program to be
3. Execute the program and grant UA
4. Test your work

## But why this branch?
To answer the call of community, a "silent" build is created, 
which simply changed the type of this Visual C# project to
_Windows Application_, so that no console will bump up.

However, there are drawbacks, as you couldn't see logs
easily.

You may wonder: Why don't you just make a graphical interface?

Well, I could, but I want to keep the app simple. If you like,
just write it yourself.
